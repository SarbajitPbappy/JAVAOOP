Problem Statement:

You are building a music playlist application. Each playlist can contain multiple songs, and
each song can belong to multiple playlists. Implement this system using aggregation.

Tasks:

Create the Song class with attributes like title, artist, and duration.

Create the Playlist class with a name and a list of songs.

Implement methods to add songs to a playlist and display the playlist's content.

Create instances of the classes and demonstrate the system by adding songs to a
playlist and displaying its content.
